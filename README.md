# Clickbait Strength Prediction and control

This repository contains the code implementation of paper titled[**"Predicting Clickbait Strength in Online Social Media"**](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.425.pdf) published in 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics(COLING-2020).

1) The aim of this project is to predict the intensity of clickbait and identify the words/phrases in the headline that actually make it clickbaity. The goal is to come up with a way to increase or decrease the clickbait intensity by substituting these words.
2) Used various regression algorithms (linear, ridge , random forest, gradient/adaboost) with various contextual word embedding techniques such as BERT, RoBERTa, and Universal Sentence Embeddings for predicting the intensity and a paraphrase model for reducing the intensity.
